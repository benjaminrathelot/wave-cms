# wave-cms
Wave CMS is a minimalistic open-source Content Management System based on AngularJS and PHP. It implements some default fonctionnalities: an administration interface to edit site settings, create pages and articles, manage users and 2 working plugins (contact form and social icons). As you might have guessed, this is not an achieved project but it can already be used and improved by developers thanks to its plugin interface:
- You can use the JSON Database in your plugin.
- You can add Angular controllers, templates, routes, scripts, CSS to the admin and user interface directly using the PHP Object PU (Plugin Utilities).
- You can add menu links and widgets directly from your plugin.
- Your plugin can use modules written in PHP (cf. default plugins).
- Bootstrap, Font Awesome, AngularJS, jQuery, Summernote included.
- File upload function, captcha system.


I will write some more details about this codebase & a documentation for developers later. Feel free to contact me to add plugins or improvements. Theming hasn't been introduced yet.
